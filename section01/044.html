    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	
    <p>RSE-044 is an approximately one square mile region in the Class A airspace area above the Arch of Triumph, classified RSE-044-1, in Pyongyang, North Korea. The exact barriers of RSE-044 are unknown, the one square mile area is only approximated as previously stated. After the discovery of RSE-044, the hours in which visitors are able to observe RSE-044-1 have been shortened tremendously in the case of an unexpected RSE-044 passage. See below for more details.
	<br>
	<br>
	Any aircraft that passes through RSE-044 will suddenly vanish without explanation. This can be observed and is often described as the aircraft passing through an invisible gradient. It is unknown where RSE-044 redirects these flights to, as tracking devices placed on flights are not able to capture their location after passing through RSE-044. Aircrafts that vanish after passing through RSE-044 will reappear at random intervals, in some cases lasting as short as two days and in others as long as ten years. To onboard passengers, RSE-044 is negligible and they are not able to recount vanishing after re-emergence. Everything that passes through RSE-044 will reappear unscathed.

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
	
	<p>Due to the nature of RSE-044, it cannot be contained. However, RSE personnel are to be stationed in the vicinity of RSE-044-1 and are to monitor surrounding air traffic. All routes passing through the area have been redirected after the discovery of RSE-044. Note that the danger classification of 2 refers to possible psychological damage inflicted on those who witness an aircraft passing through RSE-044.</p>
