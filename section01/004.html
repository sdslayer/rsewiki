    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	
    <p>RSE-004 is best described as a blue colored hexapod with a large ovoid for a head. It has the ability to phase through any walls thinner than 3 feet of solid material. This had led to many incidents of homicide caused by RSE-004, as it has recorded history of kidnapping people, taking them as hostages for anywhere between 3 days and 2 months, before ultimately killing them.
<br>
<br>
RSE-004 was captured on July 22nd, ███ after a 15-hour long chase in Colorado through combined cooperation of the RSE Foundation as well as numerous Colorado city and county police personnel. It was apprehended about 5 miles from the county center of Arapahoe County, Colorado.<br><br>

RSE-004, as stated before, can phase through thin walls. However, it can not phase through people or any other living organisms. RSE-004 also, while not having any visible mouth, is able to emit human-like speech, although it appears to only know how to speak Italian. Attempts at using internet translation services are unsuccessful on RSE-004.<br>

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">RSE-004 is kept in a containment chamber at Location 03 in a cubic room. The walls are 15 feet thick and are solid reinforced iron. There is a motion detecting camera mounted in the corner of the chamber to monitor any attempts at breaching containment.</p>

*Both observers are viewing the experiment by controlling the camera in the containment unit*<br>
*TS909 is lowered through a hole in the ceiling by rope into RSE-004’s containment chamber*<br><br>
Dr. Mason: Alright, 909, good luck.<br><br>
TS909: What the fuck is that even supposed to mean? You people are fucking killing us<br>and you know it. Do you feel ANY shame? You are a vile, subhuman--<br><br>
Dr. Josh: Yeah alright 909, that’s enough please, thank you.<br><br>
*TS909 hits the ground of the chamber*<br>
*TS909 screams as RSE-004 immediately lunges across the cell at TS909 and begins bludgeoning him to death*<br>
