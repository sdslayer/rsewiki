    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	
    <p>RSE-036 is a 25-year-old Caucasian male with the given name 'Kyle Ritters'. RSE-036 has curly blonde hair, sky blue eyes, and white teeth of grotesque
proportions. Upon viewing RSE-036, he seems completely normal, but the anomalous properties come into play when identifying his ability.
RSE-036 is unable to be harmed or killed. As a result of this, he attempts to commit mass homicide via different methods corresponding to what
items he has access to. [see INCIDENT LOGS for more information]</p>
