    <p>RSE-031 refers to the collection of several entities, classified as RSE-031-01 through RSE-031-13. They all appear to be clones of the same tall,
      handsome male of Mexican descent. Each individual subject, however, has a different personality over all and therefore acts differently. However,
      not all 13 instances of RSE-031 are always visible, or as they refer to it, 'active'. When a subject of RSE-031 is inactive,
      they are supposedly on lunch break in the astral realm.
      <br>​
      RSE-031 instances seem to have only one goal as a collective group, and that is to give a judgement to literally everything in the known and unknown universes.
      Each instance of RSE-031 is suspected to have only been placed in this universe to have another bias on each judgement. They are able to jump across space and time,
      to reach whatever destination they please so they really can't be contained. Check Containment Procedures for more details.
      ​<br>
      RSE-031's ability to jump space and time seems to only be used when necessary. However, it is unknown why the RSE-031 instances caused major events in history,
      that ultimately changed everything, such as slavery. This ended up, however, being a good thing, because shortly after, N.W.A released their banger of a single,
      'Fuck The Police'.

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>

    <p style="text-align:center;">RSE-031, unfortunately, can not be contained. However, RSE-031 instances have their own meeting room within the basement sector of Location 01. Within this room,
      they plan out the judgements they will give out. RSE-031 instances are able to leave whenever they please, most of the time to conduct a judgement.
      It is unknown how each instance developed this ability.
