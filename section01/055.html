    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	
    <p>RSE-055 is an anomalous strain of cannabis sativa characterized visually by its vibrant blue color. RSE-055 can be found in various forms in which marijuana can be consumed, i.e. by the flower, edibles, or vape pens and cartridges. Each of these methods were initially discovered being distributed in stores, being manufactured by an unknown company, and the hypothetical physical location where RSE-055 instances are produced has yet to be found.
<br><br>
      Like traditional marijuana, ingesting RSE-055 grants an overwhelming feeling of euphoria, as well as reduced brain function. However, any cuts or damage located on the body of the user will completely heal by unknown means over time throughout their high. The mechanism underlying this accelerated healing remains elusive, as no observable changes in cellular morphology or molecular markers were detected throughout various studies.
      <br>

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
	
	<p>RSE-055 is actively grown at various sites’ plant nurseries, with large plots entirely dedicated to growing RSE-055 being found at Locations ██ and ██. Edible chocolate bars containing RSE-055 concentrate can be found in the front of the medical bay at each RSE Location, and patients suffering serious injuries are to be given RSE-055 concentrate via intravenous therapy (IV).</p>
