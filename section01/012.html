    <p>RSE-012 is an antique chair made of leather. The chair has the ability to teleport around into any open space relative to where it is, making it semi-difficult to contain. The chair usually, if not limited or confined, will teleport to abandoned or areas in the middle of nowhere far away from urban areas.<br>
It has been reported being seen in abandoned factories, warehouses, fields near farmhouses, under bridges, and floating in rivers. It never gets damaged from any of the surroundings it teleports to.<br>
Sometimes an unsuspecting person will spot the chair and take it with them, likely because it appears in mint condition, as if it came straight from a furniture store. When they sit on the chair, it will always break.<br>
The victim will then, over the next 20-30 minutes, suffer convulsions, heart palpitations, muscle aches, a heart attack, then go into a coma and die.<br>
Upon its last victim dying, it will repair itself to a new state and teleport to the location it was in when it was taken last.<br>
It is rare to be found since there is only one in the world, and there have been 5 reported deaths between the years 19██ and 20██, likely because of how remote the locations it teleports to are.

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">RSE-012 is located within a padded cell in Location 01. Level 5 clearance is required to access the chair as it can teleport out of its cell if there are any openings in the room. The room must be sealed whenever someone is not entering or exiting.</p>
