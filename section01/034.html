    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	
    <p>RSE-034 is a static camera view of the corner of a room in █████████, Texas, with the room itself being designated RSE-034-Alpha. Within the
corner is a record player, designated RSE-034-1, a phone which appears to be a Samsung brand Galaxy S9, designated RSE-034-2, an empty water
bottle, designated RSE-034-3, and a nightstand, designated RSE-034-4. Each of these items located within the corner have anomalous traits. While
not being a threat directly, the anomaly itself caught the attention of the RSE Association - and was classified as an RSE shortly after.<br><br>

RSE-034-1 is a Byron Statics brand record player, which is constantly on. Oddly enough, the diamond located on the arm of the record player has
not yet broken, despite the amount of time that the record player has been turned on. The record player is constantly playing the album
'The Slow Rush' by Tame Impala, with 5 minutes of silence occuring after the final song on the record. The volume on the record player appears
to fluctuate, sometimes being very quiet - or unnecessarily loud.<br><br>

RSE-034-2 is a Samsung brand Galaxy S9, which appears to be playing the same video of pornography on loop - with no volume. Despite not having
any clear charger plugged into it, the phone has been turned on since the RSE Association located this RSE.<br><br>

RSE-034-3 is an empty Ozarka water bottle. The anomalous traits of this Sub-RSE are not always clear, as the traits are hardly ever displayed.
Ocasionally, the water bottle will flip over on its opposite end. The water bottle also appears to lose or gain its cap at random.<br><br>

RSE-034-4 is a black nightstand of an unidentifiable brand. The drawers seem to be pulled out and closed at random, with no clear operator doing
so. There is a small combustion within the drawers once a month, though no clear damage is visualized.

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">RSE-034-Alpha is located in a suburban household with no entrance. Despite the RSE Association's many attempts to enter, it seems that no person
has ever set foot into RSE-034-Alpha. RSE-034 itself is displayed on a monitor in Location 01's Sector 03, in Dr. Mason's office.
