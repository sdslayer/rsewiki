    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	
    <p> RSE-014 refers to an anomalous occurrence in various RSE locations. RSE-014 does not bear a physical form. RSE-014 occurs very infrequently, and no patterns have been recognized besides being reported slightly more frequent during the last three months of the year.
<br>
<br>
RSE-014 will grant any wish at seemingly inappropriate times, even if not regarded to RSE-014 directly. The upper limit of what a subject may wish for is unknown, but wishes that are considered absurd by most are very rarely granted.
<br>
<br>
RSE-014 was theorized after multiple occurrences, but ultimately discovered on July 2, 2021 after the young child of Dr. Gasca wished he ‘wasn’t alive.’ Two days later, Gasca suffered a heart attack in the middle of bonding with his child at the on-site playground. The only evidence of this event occurring is this summary.

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">Due to the nature of RSE-014, it is not able to be contained. However, any RSE personnel under the clearance level of 4 are not to be informed of its existence. In the case of an RSE-014 event occurring, which would imply its existence to unknowing personnel, the minds of those witnessing the event are to have any information regarding it wiped.
