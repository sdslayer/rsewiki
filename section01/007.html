    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	
    <p> RSE-007 is a sentient, grotesquely large tooth resembling that of a human molar, with the self given name ‘Jerry.’ RSE-007, as of January 1, 2022, has been observed at a height of 1.2 meters and a weight of 54 kilograms. RSE-007 is capable of highly intelligent speech in English, and has been described as being ‘incredibly friendly’ with no noted occurrence of it being hostile towards any RSE personnel.
<br>
<br>
RSE-007 was artificially manufactured by a highly skilled RSE researcher sometime in August 1998 as a defense mechanism against most mid-level danger class RSE specimen. It was given the ability to channel power and release it in a controlled beam capable of piercing thick steel, and is often used at a low power level to sedate RSE specimen who have breached containment.

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
	
	<p>RSE-007 is held in its own room in the living quarters sector of Location 01. RSE-007 is able to freely roam most low clearance areas of each location. RSE-007 is to be notified immediately after a breach has occurred and quickly transported to the location of the breach.</p>

	<div>Date: Tuesday, September 1, 1998 [2:30PM]</div><br>
	<div>Observer(s): Dr. Wood</div><br>
	<div>Subject(s): RSE-007, Steel bar</div><br>
	<div style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;
	font-variant:small-caps;font-size: 20px;">
*RSE-007 is instructed to utilize its beaming ability to penetrate a large steel bar*<br>
RSE-007: I can do that. Let's see...<br>
*RSE-007 turns on its side and begins to emit a blinding light at its top*<br>
*The light slowly turns into a beam and travels towards the bar*<br>
*On impact, the beam slowly melts the bar until a large pile of scrap remains*<br>
RSE-007: Damn.<br>
Dr. Wood: Damn.</div>
