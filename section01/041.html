    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	
    <p>RSE-041 is a leaf that does not appear to have come from any tree. It was found off the side of US Route 33 near Fort Wayne, Indiana. The leaf is covered in a thin layer of liquid. It is unsure what the liquid is, however it has been determined to be some form of neurotoxin that acts when it is touched, consumed, or breathed in. Contact with RSE-041 usually results in death in about 2 hours. During this time, seizures, foaming of the mouth, heart palpitations, feverish temperatures, headaches and high blood pressure have all been observed in various test subjects. The cause of death is usually asphyxiation as a result of loss of control of the nerves and muscle tissue that control breathing.
	<br>
	RSE-041 has been observed to also be immune to methods of termination as well, as it can not be ripped apart, and the liquid covering it seems to be flame-resistant as the leaf can not be burned.

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">RSE-041 is kept in a metal safe in a temperate room year-round in Location 01 that requires level 4 clearance to enter, although level 4 staff must get level 5 approval to enter on their own beforehand.</p>

*35 minutes later, TS27 reports feeling feverish, his temperature is recorded at 104 degrees Fahrenheit*<br>
*77 minutes later, TS27 begins violently coughing; some of these coughs include blood*<br>
*112 minutes later, TS27 curls up holding his stomach and falls over, reporting immense stomach pain*<br>
*125 minutes after initially interacting with RSE-041, TS27’s arms fall to the floor and the subject becomes unresponsive*<br>
