    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>


   
	
    <p> RSE-033 is a hotel located in New Lixadonia, Grushia. When viewed from the outside, the hotel looks completely normal. The same goes for the interior,
until entering the elevator. Once the elevator goes to another floor, it will arrive at said floor with that floor being seemingly infinite, in the form of a maze.
There has been no discovered end, with the exception of there being a 50m x 50m courtyard in the "center" of the maze. When turning your first corner on the floor,
the hallway you just left "resets", with the elevator being replaced with another hallway. Inside the endless floor is a collection of sentient vacuum cleaners,
classified as RSE-033-XX. As of 3/21/2020, there are 24 vacuum cleaners throughout the area of the floor that has been explored.<br>
These vacuum cleaners are highly hostile and will attack and kill anyone they spot. Each vacuum cleaner is a different color,
but this seems to have no effect on the vacuum cleaner's ability.

    <h3>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
	
	<p style="text-align:center;">Fortunately enough, the location of RSE-033 happens to be only 5 miles from Location ██. The hotel is closed to patrons and is guarded by 12 guards constantly.<br>
The site is checked on the 21st of each month, to avoid █████ from █████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████.</p>
