    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	
    <p> RSE-002 is one of the Agents of Chaos created by RSE-010, made in 1340. RSE-002 is a very intelligent tractor and has a keen sense of bloodlust. RSE-002 externally very closely resembles John Deere 9R Series Tractors, but is over twice the size and has drastically different inner workings. RSE scientists have spent years trying to understand how RSE-002 works, and have so far come up with nothing. RSE-002 cannot speak, but does appear to be able to understand human speech.<br>

The A.O.C are suspected to be the true cause of the Black Death that occurred in Europe in 1346. Research into the A.O.C has suggested that the millions of deaths in Medieval Europe were caused not by disease, but instead by a war between the A.O.C and humans. This war has been dubbed The First RSE War. It is believed that RSE-002 specialized in mowing down fortresses and villages due to its large size.
