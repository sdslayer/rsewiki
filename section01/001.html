    <p>RSE-001 is a talking hand with smaller hands at its fingertips. It is known to greatly enjoy giving handshakes and having conversations with people. RSE-001 is permanently lubricated with an unknown brand of lotion. It is believed that the hand itself somehow makes the lotion itself. When asked why it needs to lubricate itself, RSE-001 responded “to keep my handshakes smooth.” Due to RSE-001 being just a hand, it’s handshakes are less like handshakes and more like sporadic up and down movements. These traits are how it earned the name Lotion Motion.</p>
